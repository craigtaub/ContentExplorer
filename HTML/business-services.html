<span style="font-size: small;">When you are too busy 
trying to do everything to promote yourself and get the orders in, take 
on new employees or deal with the latest legislation, it seems too much 
to start writing things down into formal guidance, processes or training
 manuals.&nbsp; However, over time these are the things you need to do to 
ensure that your business can survive and continue if something 
unexpected happens, if you are faced with an audit, if you need to 
induct and train new staff or you want to apply for funding to expand 
your business or project.<br><br>  The services that I can 
provide will assist you in making sure that the foundations that you 
have worked so hard in building a successful business or project are 
solid and sound and are there for you to confidently explain, 
demonstrate or defend.&nbsp; <br><br><b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Business Process Mapping</b></span><span style="font-size: small;">
  - even the simplest concepts and topics can be difficult to explain if 
all you have is the knowledge and experience in your head or only in a 
few Word documents, especially if you have to explain it under 
pressure.&nbsp; In the fast-paced world we live in now most senior managers, 
clients or potential partners do not have the time to read through large
 volumes of information on what you do.&nbsp; They want to know in a one page
 document or five minute presentation what you can offer or what your 
processes are.<br><br>  You will gain more credibility if you and your 
employees can explain what you do accurately and succinctly.&nbsp; By having a
 flow chart or diagram that explains what you do saves time and is 
likely to demonstrate confidence in you as an employer, service 
provider, project/funding manager or business person.<br><br>  Through 
detailed interviews, design and clarification reviews, I 
will work with you to ensure that all the knowledge that you have built 
up is transferred from your head to paper or interactive electronic 
medium.&nbsp; Through this process, I can also suggest areas where 
improvements can be made through further detailed guidance, checklists 
or the introduction or improvement of management and control processes.<br><br><b style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Document Services</b></span><span style="font-size: small;"> - with the internet being used to research your business or projects the
 appearance and content of your website are paramount.&nbsp; First 
impressions count and that also goes for your documentation whether it 
is your training manuals, policies, blog posts or articles.&nbsp; The 
sometimes careless misplacing of an apostrophe or the wrong use or 
spelling of a word or name could mean the loss of potential business or 
contracts, especially if your main work is providing reports or 
documents.&nbsp; <br><br>  With an eye for detail and a creative edge, I can help you with the following document services:</span></div>

  - do you manage a funded project that requires you to complete regular 
monitoring reports to your funders?&nbsp; If so, I can take the 
hassle out of the drafting of it for you.&nbsp; With experience of analysing 
monitoring reports from a funder’s perspective, we know what is normally
 required and how to present it.<br><br><b style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Independent review of funding applications</b></span><span style="font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: small;"> - if you’ve ever applied for funding before, you’ll be aware that funders are looking for specific things in terms of </span></div>
<ul style="color: black; font-family: Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; text-align: justify;">
<li><span style="font-size: small;">  How will the funding add value to the project?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Is there a definite well-researched need for the project?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: small;">Does your organisation have the capacity to undertake and deliver a successful project&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: small;">and manage the funding properly?</span></li>
